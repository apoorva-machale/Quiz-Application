# Quiz Application

A simple flutter project where in you answer a few questions and then get a response accordingly.
To run application - flutter run

This Flutter quiz application was built primarily as a learning tool for myself to explore the capabilities of the Flutter framework. However, I believe it can also be valuable for anyone looking to practice their Flutter development skills and gain experience building a functional user interface. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different functionalities, and adapt it to create your own interactive quizzes!
